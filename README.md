# j2objc-gradle
Gradle Plugin for [J2ObjC](https://github.com/google/j2objc), which is an open-source tool
from Google that translates Java source code to Objective-C for the iOS (iPhone/iPad) platform.
The plugin is not affiliated with Google but was developed by former Google Engineers and others.
J2ObjC enables Java source to be part of an iOS application's build, as no editing of the
generated files is necessary. The goal is to write an app's non-UI code (such as application
logic and data models) in Java, which is then shared by web apps (using GWT), Android apps,
and iOS apps.


### Usage
At HEAD, this plugin is in a state of significant flux as we refactor it into a first-class
Gradle plugin for our beta. You may wish to wait for the beta release as we may make backwards
incompatible changes before that point.

You should start with a clean java only project without any android dependencies. It suggested that
this project is named `'shared'`. It must be buildable using Gradle's standard `'java'` plugin.
It may start as an empty project and allows you to gradually shift over code from an existing
Android application. See the section below on [Folder Structure](#folder-structure).

This is how to configure the build.gradle in your java only project. Please follow the link to
find the latest version number of the plugin:

    // File: shared/build.gradle
    plugins {
        id 'java'
        // Modify with latest version:
        // https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.j2objccontrib.j2objcgradle
        id 'com.github.j2objccontrib.j2objcgradle' version 'X.Y.Z-alpha'
    }

    // Plugin settings:
    j2objcConfig {
        xcodeProjectDir "${projectDir}/../ios"   // Xcode workspace directory
        xcodeTarget "IosApp"                     // Xcode application target name
    
        // Other Settings:
        // https://github.com/j2objc-contrib/j2objc-gradle/blob/master/src/main/groovy/com/github/j2objccontrib/j2objcgradle/J2objcConfig.groovy#L25
        
        // You must include this call at the end of j2objcConfig, regardless of settings
        finalConfigure()
    }

Within the Android application's project `build.gradle`, make it dependent on the `shared` project:

    // File: android/build.gradle
    dependencies {
        compile project(':shared')
    }


### Folder Structure

This is the suggested folder structure. It also shows a number of generated files and
folders that aren't committed to your repository. Files are shown before folder, so it
is not in strict alphabetical order.

    workspace
    ├── .gitignore                     // Should exclude: local.properties, settings.gradle, build/, ...
    ├── build.gradle

        │   └── lib-with-src.jar       // library with source can be translated
        └── src/...                    // src/main/java/... shared code for translation


### Tasks

These are the main tasks for the plugin:

    j2objcCycleFinder       - Find cycles that can cause memory leaks, see notes below
    j2objcTranslate         - Translates to Objective-C
    j2objcAssemble          - Builds debug/release libraries, packs targets in to fat libraries
    j2objcTest              - Runs all JUnit tests, as translated into Objective-C
    j2objcBuild             - Builds and tests all j2objc outputs.
    j2objcXcode             - Configure Xcode to link to static library and header files

Note that you can use the Gradle shorthand of `$ gradlew jA` to do the `j2objcAssemble` task.
The other shorthand expressions are `jCF, jTr, jA, jTe, jB and jX`.


#### Task Enable and Disable

You can disable tasks performed by the plugin using the following configuration block in your
`build.gradle`. This is separate and alongside the j2objcConfig settings. For example, to
disable the `j2objcTest` task, do the following:

    j2objcTest {
        enabled = false
    }

    j2objcConfig {
        ...
    }


#### j2objcCycleFinder

This task is disabled by default as it requires greater sophistication to use. It runs the
`cycle_finder` tool in the J2ObjC release to detect memory cycles in your application.
Objects that are part of a memory cycle on iOS won't be deleted as it doesn't support
garbage collection.

The basic setup will implicitly check for 40 memory cycles - this is the expected number
of erroneous matches with `jre_emul` library for j2objc version 0.9.6.1. This may cause
issues if this number changes with future versions of j2objc libraries.

    j2objcCycleFinder {
        enabled = true
    }
